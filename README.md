# Spotify 2019 Wrapped Analysis

Every year I look forward to the annual analysis of my Spotify use. This year was no different! 
Upon examining their summary, I saw a couple questionable results. For example, they had The Beatles listed as my number one listened to artist, while I love The Beatles, I didn't think they were my top artist. I looked to Twitter under the trending #spotifywrapped2019 to see if anyone else was experiencing something strange. I found that a whole group of people were having issues. This inspired me to retrieve my data from Spotify and perform my own analysis to see what my annual results were. 


Now I'm not exactly sure how Spotify performs the analyses, but I attempted to recreate the statistics they provided in the visuals.

#### The questions I focused on were:

- Who was my #1 artist?
- Who were my top 5 artists?
- What were my top 10 songs?
- How much time did I spend listening to songs on Spotify?



This is in no way meant to disrespect Spotify and their efforts. I appreciate their platform and decided to do this analysis for personal entertainment!
